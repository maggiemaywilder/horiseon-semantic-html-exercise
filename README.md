# Semantic HTML excercise for the fictitious Horiseon Digital Marketing firm

KU bootcamp week one homework: Diving into static web pages, this exercise allowed me to explore the best ways to make code more readable and semantic. Modifying existing code to improve semantics and code readability allowed me to further cement my understanding of CSS syntax and how specificity defines what is displayed. Streamlining the number of needed selectors to minimize duplication helped me to start identify what's necessary and what's extraneous.
