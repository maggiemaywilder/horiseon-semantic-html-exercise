The [Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg) on YouTube has been my go-to as I solidify my understanding and use of Git and GitHub. 

[Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZv4d5rbIKd4QHMPkcABCw) and [Jacqualyn Blizzard-Caron](https://www.youtube.com/user/jblizzaCU) on YouTube were invaluable with their tutorials on CSS.
